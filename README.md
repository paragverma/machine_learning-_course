#### Course overview and my review: 
> This a great place to start in this field, since the authors make sure that the content is not too heavy, but is also challenging. Sources and reading material for people who want to go deep into the mathematical aspects of the algorithms are also provided, but overall the theme is more applied, focussing on giving users a way to incorporate the knowldege as quickly as they can. Some topics like Neural Networks, Bossting algorithms have only been touched upon, not going into too much detail. As a beginner course, enjoyed it thoroughly and recommended for people who want to break into this field.
